# Upgrad_BikeSharingLRAssignment
> The project is an assignment to build a machine learning multiple linear regression model that analyses the dataset of a us based bike sharing company. The dataset contains detailed information captured by the company on a daily basis such as number of bikes rented by individuals, the type of rentals was it a casual rental or by a registered user, the date on which the bikes were rented, the temperature, humidity of the day, was it a working day or a holiday etc. The goal of the machine learning model is to find out the parameters that contribute to increase in the rentals of bike. These parameters can be analysed by the company to make business decisions to increase the rentals of bike in the future.

## General Information
- The machine learning model analyses the data set of a bike sharing company
- It builds a model that shows the attributes of columns of the data set which impact the rental of a bike
- These columns can be attributed to the business decisions made by the company to increase the rentals of bike
- The accuracy of the model shows the percentage of data that can be described using the model (such as 80% or 90%)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Rentals of bikes went up in year 2019
- The total number rentals on bikes is higher in Fall, Summer and Winter season than Spring probably because of people being on vacation in spring season
- People tend to rent bikes more between June to November month (explained by Fall and Winter Season)
- Number of rentals is very low in Light Snow compared compared to Misty and Clear weather
- More people have rented bikes during holidays
- Working day plays not much significant role in renting of the bikes
- There is no significant relationship between the day of the week with number of rentals of a bike
